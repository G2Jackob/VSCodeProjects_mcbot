Done:
+ coords reading from F3
+ moveing by coordinates (custom OCR Tesseract model), model for OCR is mc3
+ Odering by best = (confidence * size *0,3) , then (0,95 * distance[range 0-5000] + 0,05 * best)
+ Works like shit in the night and rain (weather/day_cycle false)


To fix:
- 

- model sometiemes loses tagets when too close or mined
