Done:
+ coords reading from F3
+ moveing by coordinates
+ Odering by best = (confidence * 0,7 + size *0,3) , then (0,95 * distance + 0,05 * best)

To fix:
- Taking coordintes is buggy (sometmes the targeted block cords are wrong)
- Works like shit in the night and rain
- model sometiemes loses tagets when too close or mined
